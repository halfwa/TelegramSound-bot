## Getting Started

Make sure you have [installed](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) and [configured](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers/wiki/Windows-setup#configure-docker) docker in your environment. Then you need to add the API TOKEN of your telegram bot in the file `Program.cs`. After that, you can run the below commands from the **/src/** directory and get started with the `TelegramSound` immediately.

```powershell
docker build
docker run
```
